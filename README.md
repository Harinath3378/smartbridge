#  Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. Churn prediction helps in identifying those customers who are likely to leave a company.

Customer churn means shifting from one service provider to its competitor in the market. Customer churn is one of the biggest fears of any industry, particularly for the telecom industry. With an increase in the number of telecom service providers in South Asia, the level of competition is quite high. Although there are many reasons for customer churn, some of the major reasons are service dissatisfaction, costly subscription, and better alternatives. The telecom service providers strive very hard to sustain in this competition. So to sustain this competition they often try to retain their customers than acquiring new ones as it proved to be much costlier. Hence predicting churn in the telecom industry is very important.  To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
